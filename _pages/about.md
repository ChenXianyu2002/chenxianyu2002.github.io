Since September 2021, I have been studying for a Master Degree in [Apex Data and Knowledge Management Lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/), Computer Science Department, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My graduate research advisors are [Pro. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu) and [Pro. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/). I am also the member of [Zhiyuan Honors Program](https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/html/zhiyuan/) during my stage of undergraduate in Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

My academic background and industry internships are focused on information retrieval and conversational intelligence. During the postgraduate period, I worked as an intern in [Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab](http://www.noahlab.com.hk/) and had close cooperation with [China Merchants Bank](http://www.cmbchina.com/), [Taobao Live](https://taolive.taobao.com/) and [Alimama](https://www.alimama.com/index.htm). I am on Job Market now for full-time industrial position.
